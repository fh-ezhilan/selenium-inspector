# **App Name**: Selenium IDE Enhanced

## Core Features:

- Page Management: Page Creation: Allows users to create named 'pages' within the app to represent different sections or pages of the target web application.
- Locator Definition: Locator Addition: Within each page, users can add and name locators (e.g., ID, XPath, CSS selectors) for elements on the corresponding web page.
- Locator Storage: Locator Storage:  Store the defined locators in a structured format (JSON) for easy access and use by Selenium scripts.
- Code Generation: Selenium Code Generation:  Generates basic Selenium Java code snippets to interact with web elements using the stored locators.
- AI Locator: Locator Suggestion: Using a generative AI tool, suggests the optimum locator using different strategies based on the attributes and the position of the UI element.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark slate blue (#483D8B) to give a professional and sophisticated feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) to highlight important actions and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, clean, and readable interface.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for clear presentation of generated Selenium code snippets.
- Use minimalist icons to represent different actions, page sections, and locator types.
- Clear and intuitive layout with well-defined sections for page management, locator addition, and code generation.
